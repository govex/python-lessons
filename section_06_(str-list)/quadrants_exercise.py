# Exercise that you'll do in front of the group during the group exercise.
# This is a rough approximation of the code that you'll end up with in the end.
# This isn't how you'll start it off.
# The first version of your code will be incomplete and a bit wrong.
# You'll talk through the exercise, soliciting feedback from the class.
# Be sure to ask lots of questions, especially "what do we expect is going to happen here?"
# Each of the problem addresses is specifically designed to cause unexpected behavior if the program isn't written carefully.
# It's a good thing to trip over these problem addresses. Students won't learn anything from seeing you do it perfectly in one go. But they'll learn a lot from the process of iterating, finding the problem, and improving.
